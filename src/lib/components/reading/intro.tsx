        LabDAO is a decentralized science community developing a set of tools
        for scientists to coordinate online. These tools include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <OrderedList>
          <ListItem>An exchange for laboratory services</ListItem>
          <ListItem>An onboarding and team-formation process</ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            A funding ecosystem for scientific open-source developers
          </ListItem>

    title: "Why is LabDAO needed?",
    previewText: "Open source in biomedicine needs a revamp.",
    body: (
      <>
        The high cost of executing life science protocols and the low
        reproducibility of the resulting data has been a roadblock to open
        source market dynamics in biomedicine. We believe this is the result of
        several problems:
        <br />
        <br />
        <UnorderedList>
          <ListItem>
            <b>Secrecy is highly incentivized</b> and this adds to the high cost
            of implementing biomedical research tools
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <b>A lack of standards</b> for wet lab and dry lab tools leads to
            low reproducibility
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <b>Few open source communities</b> maintain and develop biomedical
            research tools
          </ListItem>
          <br />
        </UnorderedList>
        LabDAO is solving these problems by building an open market for the
        execution of biomedical experiments, defining standards around
        biomedical tools, and incentivizing contributions to these projects.

      "LabDAO needs diverse members from many different backgrounds.",

        In order to create better tools and systems to accelerate life sciences,
        the LabDAO community needs a wide variety of perspectives.
        <br />
        <br />
        The DAO brings together <b>scientists</b>, <b>inventors</b> and{" "}
        <b>entrepreneurs</b> to meet new labmates with similar interests and
        goals.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are well suited for LabDAO if you’re curious about or have
        experience in topics such as:
        <UnorderedList>
          <ListItem>Open source science</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Web3</ListItem>
          <ListItem>DAOs</ListItem>
